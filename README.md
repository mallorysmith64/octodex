# Octodex

React-ify Octocats
Octodex is a fun way to celebrate a powerful tool we use for development. In that same spirit, recreate this site

You'll identify the main Components on the page and create React components for each, breaking down those Components into smaller ones as needed.

Objectives
- Learn to identify parts of a web site as Components
- Use app-app (GAMMA stack) to build a React project
- Understand and use React components
- Stretch Objectives
- Understand and use "props" in React
- Use Array.prototype.map to render a collection of components in React

Explorer Mode:
 Figure out the main components of the page. These will be the main components in your <App> component.
 Create your React app
 Your CSS should be in index.css
 You should have at least two components...
 Clear out the implementation in the render method of App and have it render your main components.
 Use props to try to reuse components
  
Adventure Mode:
 Place the definition of each Octocat in an array of objects and use map to generate the Octocat components
 
Epic Mode:
 Put the array of Octocats in a octocats.json file and import that into your app.
OR
 Use the fetch api to retrieve the list of Octocats from this api instead
